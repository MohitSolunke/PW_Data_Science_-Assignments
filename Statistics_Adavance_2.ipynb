Here are some common situations where the normal distribution is used as a model:\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Height of Individuals**:\n",
        "   - The heights of a large population of adult men or women tend to follow a normal distribution. The mean height represents the average height of the population, while the standard deviation indicates how much individuals' heights vary from that mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Test Scores**:\n",
        "   - Standardized test scores (e.g., SAT, ACT) are often modeled using a normal distribution. The mean score reflects the average performance, and the standard deviation shows the variability in scores among test-takers.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **IQ Scores**:\n",
        "   - Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores are designed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. This allows for comparisons between individuals relative to the general population.\n",

        "\n",
        "6. **Stock Returns**:\n",

        "1. **Mean (\\( \\mu \\))**:\n",
        "   - The mean is the central location of the distribution, representing the peak of the bell curve.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Standard Deviation (\\( \\sigma \\))**:\n",

        "\n",
        "### Importance of Normal Distribution\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Central Limit Theorem**:\n",
        "   - The central limit theorem states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution. This theorem allows researchers to use normal distribution techniques to make inferences about sample means.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Statistical Inference**:\n",
        "   - Many statistical tests (such as t-tests and ANOVA) assume that the data follows a normal distribution. This makes the normal distribution fundamental for hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Descriptive Statistics**:\n",
        "   - The mean, median, and mode of a normal distribution are all equal, providing a clear measure of central tendency. This makes interpreting data easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Probability Calculations**:\n",
        "   - The normal distribution allows for easy calculations of probabilities for ranges of values using the cumulative distribution function (CDF). This is useful for understanding how likely certain outcomes are.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Modeling Errors**:\n",
        "   - Normal distribution is often used to model random errors in measurements, making it essential in experimental sciences and quality control.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Real-Life Examples of Normal Distribution\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Heights of People**:\n",
        "   - The heights of adult men and women typically follow a normal distribution. For example, the average height of adult men in the U.S. is about 175 cm with a standard deviation of approximately 7 cm. Most individuals will fall within the range of 160 cm to 190 cm.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Test Scores**:\n",
        "   - Standardized test scores, such as SAT or GRE, are often designed to have a normal distribution. For example, if the mean score of a standardized test is 500 with a standard deviation of 100, most test-takers will score between 400 and 600.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Measurement Errors**:\n",
        "   - In scientific experiments, the errors in measurement often follow a normal distribution. For instance, if a scientist measures the length of an object multiple times, the differences from the true value will typically cluster around zero (the mean error).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **IQ Scores**:\n",
        "   - IQ scores are standardized to have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. This means that most people will have IQ scores between 85 and 115, with fewer individuals scoring significantly higher or lower.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Blood Pressure**:\n",
        "   - The blood pressure measurements of a healthy population can often be modeled using a normal distribution. For example, if the average systolic blood pressure in a population is 120 mmHg with a standard deviation of 15 mmHg, most individuals will have blood pressure readings between 90 mmHg and 150 mmHg.\n",

        "6. **Finance and Stock Prices**:\n",

        "   - The samples drawn must be independent of each other. This means that the selection of one sample does not influence the selection of another. If sampling is done without replacement, the sample size should be small relative to the population size (typically no more than 10% of the population) to maintain independence.\n",

        "   - The sample size \\( n \\) should be sufficiently large. A common rule of thumb is that \\( n \\geq 30 \\) is adequate for the CLT to hold. However, if the population distribution is extremely non-normal, a larger sample size may be needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Finite Mean and Variance**:\n",

        "5. **Underlying Distribution**:\n",
        "   - While the CLT states that the sampling distribution of the mean will approach normality regardless of the original distribution, the speed of convergence to normality can vary depending on the shape of the population distribution. For highly skewed distributions, larger sample sizes may be necessary to achieve normality in the sample mean distribution.\n",
