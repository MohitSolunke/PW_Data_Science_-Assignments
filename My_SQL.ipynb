        "* Structure: SQL databases are relational and use a predefined schema, which means the structure of the data is determined before data is inserted. Data is organized into tables with rows and columns.\n",
        "* Language: They use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. SQL provides a powerful way to perform complex queries and transactions.\n",
        "* ACID Compliance: SQL databases typically follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring reliable transactions and data integrity.\n",
        "* Use Cases: They are ideal for applications that require complex queries and transactions, such as financial applications, ERP systems, and any application where data relationships are important.\n",
        "\n",
        "# NoSQL Databases:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Structure: NoSQL databases are non-relational and can have a flexible schema. They can store data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, document-oriented, column-family, or graph structures.\n",
        "* Language: NoSQL databases do not rely on SQL for querying; instead, they have their own query languages or APIs. This allows for more flexibility in handling various types of data.\n",
        "* Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, making it easier to handle large volumes of data and accommodate growing data needs by adding more servers.\n",
        "* Use Cases: They are suitable for applications that require rapid development, scalability, and the ability to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, such as big data applications, content management systems, and real-time analytics."
