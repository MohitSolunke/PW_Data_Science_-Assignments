    "- Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression involves one independent variable and one dependent variable. It aims to establish a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.\n",
    "The relationship can be represented by a straight line equation: Y = a + bX, where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, a is the intercept, and b is the slope of the line.\n",
    "It is useful for predicting or understanding how a single variable influences another.\n",
    "Example: Predicting a student's final exam score (Y) based on the number of hours they study (X). In this case, the number of hours studied is the independent variable, and the final exam score is the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression involves more than one independent variable (predictor variables) and one dependent variable.\n",
    "It extends the concept of a linear relationship by using an equation like Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bnXn, where Y is the dependent variable, X1, X2, ..., Xn are independent variables, a is the intercept, and b1, b2, ..., bn are the respective coefficients for each independent variable.\n",

    "- Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable should be linear. This means that changes in the independent variables should result in proportional changes in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independence of Errors: The errors (residuals) in the model should be independent of each other. In other words, the value of the error term for one observation should not be influenced by the error term for any other observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: Homoscedasticity means that the variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of residuals should be roughly consistent along the range of predicted values.\n",

    "- Normality of Residuals: The residuals should follow a normal distribution. This assumption is important for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals.\n",

    "- Slope (b):\n",
    "The slope of 2,500 means that, on average, for each additional year of experience, an employee's salary is expected to increase by $2,500, assuming all other factors remain constant. This indicates a positive linear relationship between years of experience and salary, with each additional year of experience contributing positively to salary.\n",

    "The intercept of $40,000 represents the estimated starting salary for someone with zero years of experience. In this context, it's important to recognize that it may not be practically meaningful to have zero years of experience for an employee. However, the intercept provides a reference point for the regression line."

    "Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm in machine learning, essential for minimizing cost functions associated with models. It operates iteratively, continuously updating model parameters to reduce the error between predicted and actual values. The process involves calculating the gradient of the cost function, representing the direction of steepest ascent, and then taking steps in the opposite direction, controlled by a learning rate. Different variants, such as Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Mini-batch Gradient Descent, cater to various data sizes and noise levels. Gradient Descent is employed in training numerous machine learning models, ensuring they converge to optimal parameter values and improve predictive accuracy by minimizing the cost."
