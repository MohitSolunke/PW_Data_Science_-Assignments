        "Flask Framework is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, designed for building web applications quickly and with minimal boilerplate code. It is classified as a micro-framework, meaning it provides the essentials for web development without the complexities of larger frameworks like Django. Flask is built on the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and Jinja2 template engine, enabling developers to create robust web applications with simplicity and ease.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of Flask Framework\n",
        "Lightweight and Minimalistic: Flask is designed to be simple and unopinionated, allowing developers to add only the components they need for their application. This makes it easier to understand and use, especially for beginners.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility: Being unopinionated means that Flask allows developers the freedom to structure their applications as they see fit. There are no imposed restrictions on how to build your application, making it highly customizable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Extensive Documentation: Flask is well-documented, which is beneficial for both beginners and experienced developers. The comprehensive documentation includes tutorials, guides, and API references that facilitate learning and troubleshooting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Ecosystem of Extensions: Flask has a rich ecosystem of extensions that can easily be integrated to add functionality, such as authentication, database integration, form handling, and more. This enables developers to expand their applications without starting from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server that makes it easy to test and debug applications during development without the need for external tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "RESTful Request Dispatching: Flask is well-suited for building RESTful APIs, allowing developers to define routes easily and handle HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jinja2 Templating Engine: Flask utilizes the Jinja2 templating engine, which allows developers to create dynamic web pages by embedding Python-like expressions in HTML. This makes it easy to generate HTML content dynamically based on the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Community Support: Flask has a large and active community that contributes to its ongoing development. This community support provides access to numerous tutorials, plugins, and resources that can help developers solve problems and enhance their applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability: While Flask is lightweight, it is capable of scaling to support complex applications. Developers can build microservices or larger applications as needed, and Flask can easily handle increased loads with proper architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "Integration with Other Technologies: Flask can be easily integrated with various databases (like SQLAlchemy for relational databases), authentication systems, and front-end frameworks (like React or Angular), making it versatile for different project needs."

        "HTTP Method Handling: Flask routing allows developers to specify which HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) are accepted for a given route. This is essential for building RESTful APIs, where different methods perform different actions on resources.\n",

        "Easy Navigation: Routing simplifies navigation within the application. Users can easily access various features and pages by entering specific URLs, making the application more user-friendly.\n",
