        "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class.\n",
        "It restricts direct access to some of an object’s components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the methods and attributes.\n",

        "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts.\n",

        "* Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class can inherit the attributes and methods of another class.\n",
        "This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name.\n",
        "This can be achieved through method overriding (in subclasses) and method overloading (within the same class).\n",
        "Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n",
