        "\n",
        "1. **Nature of the Features**:\n",
        "   - **Continuous Features**: If your features are continuous and you expect them to follow a Gaussian distribution, use **Gaussian Naive Bayes**.\n",
        "   - **Discrete Features**: If your features are counts or frequencies (like word counts in text classification), choose **Multinomial Naive Bayes**.\n",

        "   - **Text Data**: For text classification problems, where the features are typically the frequency of words, **Multinomial Naive Bayes** is commonly used.\n",

        "\n",
        "6. **Model Assumptions**:\n",
