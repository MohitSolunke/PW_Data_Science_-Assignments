It stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for the storage of complex data types.

        "# Non-relational Databases\n",
        "Non-relational databases, often referred to as NoSQL databases, are designed to provide flexible data models that differ from traditional relational databases. Instead of using fixed schemas and tables, non-relational databases store data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, column families, or graphs. This flexibility allows for easier handling of diverse data types and structures, making non-relational databases well-suited for big data applications and scenarios where data requirements change frequently.\n",

        "MongoDB is a powerful NoSQL database that offers several features designed to meet the needs of modern applications. Here are some key features of MongoDB:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Document-Oriented Storage\n",
        "MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents (BSON), allowing for the representation of complex data structures. This means you can store arrays and nested objects directly in documents, making it easy to model relationships and hierarchies.\n",
        "2. Schema Flexibility\n",
        "Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not require a fixed schema. This schema-less design allows you to change the structure of your documents over time without complex migrations, making it suitable for agile development.\n",
        "3. Scalability\n",
        "MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, where data is distributed across multiple servers. This enables it to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads efficiently, making it ideal for applications expecting growth.\n",
        "4. High Performance\n",
        "MongoDB is designed for high-performance read and write operations. It uses an internal memory-first architecture, optimizing performance for real-time data processing and analytics.\n",
        "5. Indexing\n",
        "MongoDB supports various indexing options (e.g., single field, compound, geospatial, text indexing) to improve query performance. This allows developers to optimize data retrieval based on their application’s specific needs.\n",
        "6. Aggregation Framework\n",
        "MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that enables complex data processing and analysis. It allows users to perform operations like filtering, grouping, and transforming data in a pipeline format.\n",
        "7. Replication\n",
        "MongoDB offers built-in replication, allowing data to be copied across multiple servers for redundancy and high availability. This ensures that the system can recover quickly from hardware failures.\n",
        "8. Ad-hoc Queries\n",
        "MongoDB supports ad-hoc queries, meaning users can query data without needing to define a specific query structure beforehand. This flexibility allows for dynamic querying capabilities and rapid data exploration.\n",
        "9. Multi-Model Support\n",
        "MongoDB can handle various data models, including key-value, document, graph, and time-series data. This versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications.\n",
        "10. Built-in Sharding\n",
        "MongoDB automatically divides data into smaller, manageable pieces (shards) to distribute load and improve performance. This feature is particularly useful for applications with large datasets.\n",
        "11. Transactions\n",
        "With support for multi-document ACID transactions, MongoDB ensures data integrity by allowing multiple operations to be executed as a single unit of work. This is essential for applications that require reliable data processing.\n",
        "12. Easy Integration\n",
        "MongoDB provides drivers and libraries for various programming languages, making it easy to integrate with different application stacks. It also supports various cloud services for deployment."

        "In MongoDB, the methods delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() are used for removing documents from a collection or the collection itself from the database. Here’s a detailed explanation of each method:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. delete_one()\n",
        "Purpose: The delete_one() method is used to remove a single document from a collection that matches the specified filter.\n",
        "Usage: This method is ideal when you want to delete only the first document that matches a particular query criteria.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "result = collection.delete_one({'name': 'Alice'})\n",
        "print(f'Deleted {result.deleted_count} document.')\n",
        "2. delete_many()\n",
        "Purpose: The delete_many() method is used to remove multiple documents from a collection that match the specified filter.\n",
        "Usage: This method is useful when you need to delete all documents that meet certain criteria.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "result = collection.delete_many({'age': {'$lt': 30}})\n",
        "print(f'Deleted {result.deleted_count} documents.')\n",
        "3. drop()\n",
        "Purpose: The drop() method is used to remove an entire collection from the database.\n",
        "Usage: This method is typically used when you no longer need the entire collection and want to free up space or remove all its data.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "collection.drop()\n",
        "print('Collection dropped successfully.')\n",
        "Summary of Usage\n",
        "delete_one(): Use this method when you want to delete a specific document based on a unique filter. Only the first matching document will be removed.\n",
        "delete_many(): Use this method when you want to delete all documents that match a given condition. It allows for bulk deletion based on query criteria.\n",
        "drop(): Use this method to completely remove a collection and all its documents from the database. This operation is irreversible, and all data in the collection will be lost."
