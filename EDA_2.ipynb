        "\n",
        "1. **Date of Travel**: The date when the flights are booked or the departure date can provide insights into seasonal trends. Analyzing month and day can help identify high-demand periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Price**: Analyzing price trends over time can indicate peak travel seasons. Typically, higher prices correspond to high demand.\n",

        "5. **Destination**: Certain destinations may have seasonal demand (e.g., summer vacations to beach resorts, winter holidays to ski destinations).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Day of the Week**: Some days (like Fridays or Sundays) may have higher demand for travel, especially for weekend getaways.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Analysis Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Preparation**: Clean the dataset and convert the travel date to a datetime format. Extract month and day of the week as separate features.\n",
        "\n",

        "To analyze the Flight Price dataset and identify the factors that affect flight prices, you can consider several key features that typically influence pricing in the airline industry. Here's a structured approach to analyzing these features and presenting your findings:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features to Analyze:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Flight Distance**: The distance between the departure and arrival locations is a fundamental factor in flight pricing. Longer flights generally cost more.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Date of Travel**:\n",
        "   - **Seasonality**: Analyzing how prices vary by month can help identify peak and off-peak seasons.\n",
        "   - **Holidays and Weekends**: Prices may spike around holidays or weekends due to increased demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Airline**: Different airlines have varying pricing strategies. Analyzing the average prices for each airline can reveal which ones are more economical or premium.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Booking Time in Advance**: The number of days between booking and departure can significantly impact pricing; tickets purchased well in advance often have lower prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Class of Service**: Analyzing prices by class (economy, business, first class) can provide insights into how much premium customers are willing to pay for added comfort.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Day of the Week**: Prices can vary based on the day of the week; for example, flights on Fridays or Sundays may be more expensive due to weekend travelers.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Flight Duration**: Longer flights may cost more, but this could vary based on layovers and other factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Departure and Arrival Airports**: Some airports have higher fees or demand, influencing overall prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **One-way vs. Round-trip**: Analyzing price differences between one-way and round-trip tickets can provide insights into pricing strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Suggested Analysis Techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Descriptive Statistics**:\n",
        "   - Use descriptive statistics to summarize the central tendency and dispersion of flight prices based on the aforementioned features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Correlation Analysis**:\n",
        "   - Calculate correlation coefficients to understand relationships between flight prices and numerical features (e.g., distance, duration).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Visualization**:\n",
        "   - Use box plots to compare flight prices across different airlines, service classes, and days of the week.\n",
        "   - Create scatter plots to visualize the relationship between price and continuous variables like distance and duration.\n",
        "   - Use line plots to show how prices vary over time (monthly and weekly).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Regression Analysis**:\n",
        "   - Conduct multiple regression analysis to model the relationship between flight prices and the selected features. This will help quantify the impact of each feature on price.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **ANOVA**:\n",
        "   - Use ANOVA to compare the means of flight prices across categorical variables like airline, class of service, and day of the week.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Presenting Findings to the Management Team:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Executive Summary**:\n",
        "   - Start with a clear executive summary highlighting the main findings, conclusions, and actionable recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Visualizations**:\n",
        "   - Present key visualizations that clearly illustrate trends, relationships, and differences in flight prices based on the analyzed features. Ensure visuals are easy to understand and interpret.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Insights and Interpretations**:\n",
        "   - Discuss the insights gained from the analysis. For example, highlight how booking in advance generally leads to lower prices or how certain airlines consistently offer lower fares.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Recommendations**:\n",
        "   - Based on the findings, provide strategic recommendations, such as:\n",
        "     - Pricing adjustments during peak seasons.\n",
        "     - Promotions for off-peak travel to increase bookings.\n",
        "     - Targeting specific customer segments based on pricing trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Q&A Session**:\n",
        "   - Allow time for questions from the management team to clarify any points and discuss the implications of the findings.\n",
